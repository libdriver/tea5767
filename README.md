## LibDriver TEA5767

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/tea5767/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The TEA5767 is a single-chip electronically tuned FM stereo radio for low-voltage applications with fully integrated Intermediate Frequency (IF) selectivity and demodulation. The radio is completely adjustment-free and only requires a minimum of small and low cost external components. The radio can be tuned to the European, US, and Japanese FM bands.

LibDriver TEA5767 is a full-featured driver for TEA5767, launched by LibDriver. It provides FM searching, FM playing and additional features. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

/interface includes LibDriver TEA5767 IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver TEA5767 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver TEA5767 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver TEA5767 offline document.

/datasheet includes TEA5767 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_tea5767_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
float mhz;

/* init */
res = tea5767_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

/* search up */
res = tea5767_basic_search_up()；
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)tea5767_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

res = tea5767_basic_get_frequency(&mhz);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)tea5767_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}
tea5767_interface_debug_print("tea5767: frequency is %0.2fMHz.\n", mhz);

...

/* search down */
res = tea5767_basic_search_down()；
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)tea5767_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

res = tea5767_basic_get_frequency(&mhz);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)tea5767_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}
tea5767_interface_debug_print("tea5767: frequency is %0.2fMHz.\n", mhz);

...

/* enable mute */
res = tea5767_basic_set_mute(TEA5767_BOOL_TRUE);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)tea5767_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

...

/* disable mute */
res = tea5767_basic_set_mute(TEA5767_BOOL_FALSE);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)tea5767_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

...

/* set the frequency */
res = tea5767_basic_set_frequency(88.67f);
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)tea5767_basic_deinit();
    
    return 1;
}

...

/* deinit */
(void)tea5767_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
